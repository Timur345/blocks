    <h2>Hunting Abilities</h2>
        <p>Like their wild relatives, domestic cats are natural hunters able to stalk prey and pounce with sharp claws and teeth.
 They are particularly effective at night, when their light-reflecting eyes allow them to see better than much of their prey. 
 Cats also enjoy acute hearing. All cats are nimble and agile, and their long tails aid their outstanding balance.
        </p>
    <h2>Communication</h2> 
        <p>
            Cats communicate by marking trees, fence posts, or furniture with their claws or their waste.
             These scent posts are meant to inform others of a cat's home range. House cats employ a vocal repertoire that extends from a purr to a screech.  
        </p>  
    <h2>Diet</h2>   
        <p>
            Domestic cats remain largely carnivorous, and have evolved a simple gut appropriate for raw meat. 
            They also retain the rough tongue that can help them clean every last morsel from an animal bone (and groom themselves). 
            Their diets vary with the whims of humans, however, and can be supplemented by the cat's own hunting successes.
